# ICT1002-Python

ICT1002 Project Work

This repository contains the source code, in partial fulfilment, of the module ICT1002 Programming Fundamentals. 

## Description

The project aims to analyse dataset to determine if an attack has happened.  
Currently, the project is able to parse `sshd` & `FileZilla FTP Server` logs, and perform analysis on it.

Upon analysis, the dashboard will present several graphs to allow for analysts to better understand what's going on, from the logs submitted. The dashbard would also highlight potential attacks detected.
